<h2>INTRODUCTION INTO CRYPTOCURRENCY. </h2>
<p>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet.
  
    These wallets can be software that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or on your mobile device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.
</p>
 <p><b>cryptocurrencies are often bought with "fiat" or traditional currency like US dollars or euros. However, they can also be bought with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</b>
 </p>
 <h2>TYPES OF CRYPTOCURRENCY </h2>
 <p>Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's ether was designed to be used as payment for validation work done on the blockchain. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. Ripple's XRP is designed to be used by banks to facilitate transfers between different geographies.</p>
 <p>Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, it's important to understand the types of cryptocurrencies. Understanding if the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing inâ€”a cryptocurrency without a purpose is likely to be riskier than one with utility.</p>
 <p>Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Utility:</b> XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.</li>
    <li><b>Transactional:</b> Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.</li>
    <li><b>Governance:</b> These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap.</li>
    <li><b>Platform:</b> These tokens support applications built to use a blockchain, such as Solana.</li>
    <li><b>Security tokens:</b> Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millenium Sapphire.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of some cryptocurrencys are:<b>Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH),Tether (USDT),BNB (BNB),USD coin (USDC),XRP (XRP),carnado (ADA), Doge coin (DOGE),polygon (MATIC),Solana (SOL),Tron (TRX) etc</b></p>
